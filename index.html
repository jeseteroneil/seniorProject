        Last year a corona virus made a jump from animals to humans. The landing after that jump was felt across the world. After a series of events and due to the world being so interconnected the virus was able to transvers the world in a few weeks. From there the world changed and vaccine or no vaccine the world will never be the same. People have lost lives and income to this disease, but it has also taken away our mental health. Anxiety and fear of catching the disease dominate peoples lives, not having a job, worrying about putting food on the table let alone rent, and not being able to socially interact as before have pushed many people over the edge. Since January of this year I have lost two friends to suicide. Im not going to get into the specifics but they are not here anymore and the virus pushed their already fragile mental states over the edge. This site is dedicated to helping people find people who are local to chat with and socially interact with permitted guidline of your respective state/counties. We want to make this a safe space so their are certian precautions in place to promote safety. If you would like to use this app you must be 18 years or older with a valid ID or Drivers license. If you are under 18 then your parents would have to make an account for you.
